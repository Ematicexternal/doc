# Ematic.js app for Shopify

*   Adds or removes small chunks of code inside your theme assets
*   Adds or removes additional JavaScript code via [ScriptTags](https://help.shopify.com/api/reference/scripttag)

## App Installation

To install the app, enter your shop address below and you will be redirected to the app installation page. Make sure that you are logged in to your Shopify store admin.

<form action="https://shopify.ematicsolutions.com/install.php" method="get">https://<input class="form-ctrl" name="shop" type="text"> <input name="submit" type="submit" value="Install" class="btn-primary">   
</form>
_**For example:** my-web-store.myshopify.com_
