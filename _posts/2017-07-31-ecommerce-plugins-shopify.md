# Ematic.js Application for Shopify

Ematic.js installer is a Shopify application that adds or removes the Ematic.js code to your Shopify store.

What it does is:

*   Adds or removes small chunks of code inside your theme assets
*   Adds or removes additional JavaScript code via [ScriptTags](https://help.shopify.com/api/reference/scripttag)

## Application Installation

To install the app, enter your shop address below and you will be redirected to the application installation page. Make sure that you are logged in to your Shopify store admin.

<form action="https://shopify.ematicsolutions.com/install.php" method="get">https://<input class="form-ctrl" name="shop" type="text"> <input name="submit" type="submit" value="Install" class="btn-primary">   
</form>
_**For example:** my-web-store.myshopify.com_

## Configuration

### Enable Ematic.js

Once the application is installed, it can be used to install scripts to your Shopify store in order to enable Ematic.js on it.

1.  Find the **Ematic.js Installer** in your Apps section and open it. It may take some time for the application to load, so please wait for it to open.
2.  Enter your API key in the Form field, and then click _Enable_.

Note: This operation can take up to 30 seconds, so please wait for it to finish.

### Disable Ematic.js

### After new themes are installed

In case you installed a new theme to your shop, it will not have Ematic.js enabled. So you will have to go to the ematic.js Installer again in order to enable or disable scripts on **all** themes.
