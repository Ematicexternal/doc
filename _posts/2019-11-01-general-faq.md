## Is it better to have a dedicated IP address for sending email campaigns instead of using the default IP address of our ESPs?

We can't answer with a straight yes or a straight no, both circumstances have pros and cons. When you start using new IP addresses that ISPs are unfamiliar with, it may take them a while for the ISP to realize that it is not SPAM and that your IP address operates legitimately. This does not occur when you use the default IP address of your ESP because it is already known to ISPs.

To help you decide which will be more beneficial for your organization, see Should You Send From a Dedicated IP Address? (Obtained from MailChimp on October 17, 2017 available on blog.mailchimp.com).
