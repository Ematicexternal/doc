# Retry-iQ A/B Test Data

Retry-iQ enables you to conduct A/B testing or split testing. A/B testing allows you to compare between two different content to learn more about your customer's behaviours. You can monitor the progress of each experiments and it's A/B testing on this table. Your customer success managers will also be monitoring the progress and will be switching one of the content off when there is a winner among them. That way, you'll get more incremental revenue almost guaranteed!

The A/B Test Data tab shows you the performance split between the different A/B versions that capture subscribers during the specified timeframe.
