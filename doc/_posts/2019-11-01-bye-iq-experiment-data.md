## A/B Testing

Bye-iQ enables you to conduct A/B testing or split testing. A/B testing allows you to compare between two different overlays to learn more about your customer's behaviours. You can monitor the progress of each experiments and it's A/B testing on this table. Your customer success managers will also be monitoring the progress and will be switching one of the overlays off when there is a winner among them. That way, you'll get more subscribers almost guaranteed!

The Experiment Data tab also shows you the performance split between the different A/B versions that capture subscribers during the specified timeframe.
