You can also take it a step further by targeting another segment aside from Hi-iQ. 

For example, you want to target those whose birthdays fall on the month of August:

1. Click Group or new segment. 

2. Fill out the fields shown below, and then click the Add button. 
- List - Select your target list
- Segment - Remains as Group or new segment
- Contacts match - Must be All

3. Set your preferred condition using the drop-down fields. 

4. When you have completed setting your preferred target segment, click the Add button, and then set the conditions for your Hi-iQ segment.
